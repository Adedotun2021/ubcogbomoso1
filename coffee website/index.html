                <p>University Baptist Church, Ogbomoso was planted by Ori-Oke Baptist Church, Ogbomoso in 1995 and organized in 2002.
                    We have prayerfully taken some steps towards church planting and we have also provided
                    leadership by way of adoption of some Churches. It becomes very necessary to chronicle
                    the efforts as we celebrate the organization of some Churches.The goal is to
                    provide our young churches and possibly others,the opportunity to learn from our
                    successes and mistakes.
                </p>
                <p>The Church planting approach of UBC is self-sustaining approach, by this we concentrate
                    Our efforts on making the life and home of the pastor comfortable through regular
                    payment of salaries, allowances, benefits, pension, appreciation services, training and
                    retraining. Such pastor is then required to do the work for which he was called by God,
                    trained by the Convention and engaged by our Church. We hold them responsible and
                    accountable for Church growth and health, we encourage them to raise fund for church
                    physical development and demand regular reports from them..</p>

                    Discipleship in leadership is the best way to describe our leadership programs. It has
                    been the strength of the University Baptist Church, Ogbomoso. A church located among the youth
                    must simply embrace discipleship if purpose will be fulfilled.The strong emphasis on it
                    has not only led to life transformation, but also the involvement of more and more
                    members in Kingdom assignment. It has produced great leaders for the Church and
                    organizations that our graduates work with.We partner with national and
                    international organizations to bring quality leadership development programs. We
                    run the Global Leadership Summit,the Million Leaders Mandate, Teach Every
                    Nation, Walk through the Bible, among others. All these are in addition to the recognized
                    discipleship programs of the Convention. The results have been life transformation and
                    leadership capacity building..
